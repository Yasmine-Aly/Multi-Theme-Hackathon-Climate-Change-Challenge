# Multi-Theme-Hackathon-Climate-Change-Challenge

## Rainfall problem:
### Rainfall prediction remains a serious concern and has attracted the attention of governments, industries, risk management entities, as well as the scientific community. Rainfall is ### a climatic factor that affects many human activities like agricultural production, construction, power generation, forestry, and tourism, among others. To this extent, rainfall 
### prediction is essential since this variable is the one with the highest correlation with adverse natural events such as landslides, flooding, mass movements and avalanches. These ### incidents have affected society for years. Therefore, having an appropriate approach for rainfall prediction makes it possible to take preventive and mitigation measures for these ### natural phenomena.

## Rainfall solution:
### Make accurate and timely predictions of rainfall based on machine learning models like (ANN, Linear Regression, KNN, LSTM) to help us for protect us from floods.

## Dataset:
### The data describe meteorological information of Egypt for 20 years. In particular, there is a Boolean variable that indicates whether it rains on the same day, Relative Humidity,  which will be the target variable that will be tested to predict using machine learning algorithms.

## Data Prepration:
### 1-Elimination of variables
###   2-Datanormalization
###   3-Detection of outliers
## Models:
###      1-K-NN Algorithm (K-Nearest Neighbors)
###        2-Linear Regression
###       3-Neural Networks
###       4-LSTM
